# Java
More and more coffee, like Java

When I was writing C++, I am very used to a progressive coding style, and somehow I saw my professor prefers using Class/
Object-orientated style. I am not very familiar with such coding style in C++, but I know I can implement the same things in Java.

Gotta install a Java for OS to open the Eclipse for Java. Reminder: tryp to create another workspace away from the eclipse for C++. 

Here is where to download the Java OS: https://support.apple.com/kb/DL1572?viewlocale=en_US&locale=en_US
