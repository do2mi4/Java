Databases

If your website stores its data in a database, you may have the option of using full-text catalogues. 
A full-text catalogue indexes one or more fields in a table for searching. 
You can then execute an SQL query which includes a search query. 
The database returns records that are relevant your search.
FTCs are convenient because they automatically update as your data changes and they don't require additional libraries. 
However, their functionality is often limited in terms of analysis, they are not extensible, and their query languages are often not what people are used to. 
And since each catalogue is limited to a table, they may not work for you at all if your data is related through many tables. 
For more information, check out Mysql's Full Text documentation.
